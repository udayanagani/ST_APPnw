# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Application

 This Heart Attack Risk Prediction Application is a Machine Learning Web App built using Streamlit. The app uses machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of a heart attack based on various health-related parameters such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, blood sugar etc. By inputting this data, users can get a real-time prediction of their heart attack risk, enabling them to make informed health decisions.

This is a User Interface of web app:
